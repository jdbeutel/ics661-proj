J. David Beutel  ICS 661 assignment 4  2012-10-08

I compiled and ran with Groovy 1.8.7 on Fedora 14,
from the command line in the assignment4 directory, like so:

    groovy assignment4 L1-CNF.grammar < sampleInput

Other versions may also work.  The Groovy script and its dependencies
compile automatically.  The source is assignment4.groovy, CkyParser.groovy,
and (largely from assignment3) Grammar.groovy.  It will convert the
given grammar to CNF if it is not already.

The transcript of the test run on sampleInput is in the "transcript" file.
I implemented the extra credit to show all possible parses.

Also, each testing spec can be run from the command line, as shown below.
(Change : to ; and / to \ if running on Windows.)
I developed in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 11.1, which can show a diff in the
GUI when a spec fails.  I included the IntelliJ project files in this zip,
assignment4.iml and the contents of the .idea directory.
