J. David Beutel  ICS 661 project  2012-12-05

Requires: Groovy 2.0.5 (and Java)

To compile and run all three from the command line:
$ cd src
$ groovy parser/cky/CkyParser ../L1.grammar < ../probabilityInput
$ groovy parser/earley/EarleyParser.groovy ../L1.grammar < ../probabilityInput
$ groovy SemanticGrammar < ../semanticInput

The testing specs cannot be so simply run from the command line,
since I split the source into separate src and test root dirs.
I developed in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 11.1, which can show a diff in the
GUI when a spec fails.  I included the IntelliJ project files in this zip,
ics661proj.iml and the contents of the .idea directory.

I tested in Fedora 14 and
Groovy Version: 2.0.5 JVM: 1.6.0_20 Vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc. OS: Linux
